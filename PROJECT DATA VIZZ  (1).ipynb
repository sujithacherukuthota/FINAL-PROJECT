    "Most Prevalent Factors: The 'Escalation of Dispute' is by far the most common factor, contributing to 20% of the shootings. 'Drive-by Shooting' and 'Accidental' factors follow, each accounting for roughly 38% of the total number when combined. These suggest that confrontations and unintended discharges are significant contributors to school shootings.\n",

    "Mental Health Concerns: 'Suicide/Attempted' and 'Psychosis' factors are also present, suggesting that mental health issues play a role in a notable proportion of these incidents.\n",

    "Criminal Activity: 'Illegal Activity' is associated with a similar percentage as 'Suicide/Attempted', indicating that criminal actions within or around schools can escalate to violence.\n",

    "Bullying: Bullying appears as a smaller but still significant factor, which could indicate that some shootings are responses to long-term harassment or social issues within schools.\n",

    "Rarer Factors: Factors like 'Officer-Involved Shooting', 'Murder/Suicide', and 'Anger Over Grade/Suspension/Discipline' are listed as well, though they represent a very small percentage of the total. This indicates that while such motives are far less common, they still occur and need to be considered when implementing preventative measures.\n",

    "Unknown Motives: A number of incidents are marked as 'Unknown', highlighting that in several cases, the exact motives behind the shootings are not clearly understood. This underscores the complexity of the issue and the challenges in preventing such incidents.\n",

This could indicate that males are more often involved in or affected by confrontational situations that escalate to violence.\n",

A school guidance counselor attempted to subdue him and a 2nd shot was fired in the ceiling. Many members of the staffed rushed and the SRO subdued him. Allegedly, shooter attended morning classes, went to the restroom where he assembled a 12-gauge shotgun and headed to the cafeteria. Most students were still in class and went on lockdown. Shooter brought 21 rounds of ammunition and a bottle of vodka to school as well. Suspect posted on social media the morning of the shooting. Shooter talked on a recorded phone from the jail about wishing he was at Sandy Hook and not caring if his victims die. Students reported that shooter bullied other students. Shooter reported he meant to kill more people, and that \"he'd been having suicidal thought for over 6 years, not because he hates himself but because he doesn't like people and he doesn't see the point in life since we die in the end\". Parents had been divorced and there have been suicides in the family but judge threw out mental health claims. Sentenced as an adult to 35 years in prison. Police searched shooter's home and found 11 guns, including shotguns, rifles, a 9mm handgun and two antique pistols, and police also found marijuana. Shooter's father had a criminal past too. In 2010 police executed a search warrant at his home, looking for drugs and guns. Police seized a 12-gauge shotgun, along with marijuana, and prosecutors later sought the forfeiture of the shotgun and a .45-caliber handgun. Shooter's stepfather is facing charges for illegal gun possession, as he had previous grand theft charges, and drug possession.",
